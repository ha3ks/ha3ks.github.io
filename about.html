<div class="w-100">
	<p> Hi I’m Dan, a UK-based Network Security Engineer and Cybersecurity specialist with a deep focus on penetration testing, incident response and building secure, privacy-first infrastructure. My background spans network operations, ethical hacking, digital forensics and systems engineering with hands-on experience designing and defending real-world environments.
	</br></br>
	I work extensively with networking and security technologies including Linux, Cisco, Fortinet and Asterisk. I’ve built everything from automated router configuration systems to privacy-focused PBX platforms. I hold multiple cybersecurity certifications notably from Cisco, Fortinet and INE (f.k.a eLearnSecurity) and I’m continually expanding my skill set into cloud and container security using AWS, Azure, Docker and Kubernetes.
	</br></br>
	Alongside professional roles, I’ve spent years as an independent security consultant reporting high-risk vulnerabilities, presenting at security conferences and contributing to open-source and research-driven projects. I’m particularly interested in the intersection of security, automation and agentic AI—finding ways to apply intelligent workflows to real operational problems.
	</br></br>
	At my core, I enjoy breaking systems to understand them, rebuilding them stronger and helping organizations communicate and operate securely in an increasingly hostile digital landscape.
	</br></br>
