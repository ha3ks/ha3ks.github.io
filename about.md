Hi I’m Dan, a UK-based Network Security Engineer and Cybersecurity specialist with a deep focus on penetration testing, incident response and building secure, privacy-first infrastructure. My background spans network operations, ethical hacking, digital forensics and systems engineering with hands-on experience designing and defending real-world environments.

I work extensively with networking and security technologies including Linux, Cisco, Fortinet and Asterisk. I’ve built everything from automated router configuration systems to privacy-focused PBX platforms. I hold multiple cybersecurity certifications notably from Cisco, Fortinet and INE (fka eLearnSecurity) and I’m continually expanding my skill set into cloud and container security using AWS, Azure, Docker and Kubernetes.

Alongside professional roles, I’ve spent years as an independent security consultant reporting high-risk vulnerabilities, presenting at security conferences and contributing to open-source and research-driven projects. I’m particularly interested in the intersection of security, automation and agentic AI—finding ways to apply intelligent workflows to real operational problems.

At my core, I enjoy breaking systems to understand them, rebuilding them stronger and helping organizations communicate and operate securely in an increasingly hostile digital landscape.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ha3ks/ha3ks.github.io/issues/new) or [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ha3ks).

Thanks for reading!
