## Send a Movie!

[![1](/assets/blog/SendAMovie/1.jpg)](/assets/blog/SendAMovie/1.jpg)

People still remember what TickTok is right?

When it first came out during the pandemic people were obsessed with it.

So many funny clips and skits.

One caught my eye which was sending an entire movie to your enemies via text line by line.

"How Evil" I thought.

ðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆ

Obviously being a fresh faced hacker I wanted to do the same and annoy my wife by sending her entire script to 'The Bee Movie' as at the time my son was obsessed with watching it.

I miss the days it was all 'The Pirates of the Caribbean' films constantly all day every day...

Anyway, I wanted to build it, so I did.

I found a good [blog post](https://davidwalsh.name/how-to-send-an-imessage-from-command-line) from David Walsh on sending a message from the command line.

I had a MacVM at the time so figured since my iCloud worked on it I could send the messages via that, and It worked.

I can't find the original video on my phone but I do have the post I made on LinkedIn so you can see it in action.
