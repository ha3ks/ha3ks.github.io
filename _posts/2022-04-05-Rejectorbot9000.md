## Rejectorbot9000

[![1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ha3ks/Rejectorbot9000/refs/heads/main/Rejector.gif)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ha3ks/Rejectorbot9000/refs/heads/main/Rejector.gif)

The Intrusive thoughts took over on this one.

I don't know how many of my followers are fellow job seekers, but we have all been there haven't we?

You go on LinkedIn, make a nice profile and check all the boxes... start looking for work.. find some awesome jobs and stunning pay scales... Hit apply

And a week later you get an auto rejection email from LinkedIn to your mailbox.

Just when you thought you might be getting somewhere... ðŸ’©

Well I got darned tired of that noise, so I leaned on my Python programming and made a script that would reject me for me.

Now the crippling and pointless annoyance of rejection can be mine near instantly!

It's not an 'overly complex' beast so here is the source:
