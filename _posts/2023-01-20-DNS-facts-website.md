## DNS Facts* Website

[![1](/assets/blog/DNSFacts/1.png)](/assets/blog/DNSFacts/1.png)

In all honesty this site was constructed to suit a comical need.

As readers of my blog are aware I spend a small amount of my time disproving the LinkedIn DNS Snake Oil peddler - Andy Jenkinson.

Felling a little more 'fun' that day I put together a very basic website that has a button on it, each time you click a new DNS 'fact' would be displayed.

Needless to say this was only a quick project as you might be able to tell but at least it's funny:
