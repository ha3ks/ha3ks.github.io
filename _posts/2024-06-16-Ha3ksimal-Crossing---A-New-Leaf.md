Hello friends, I really should update the blog more often. 

I find myself more active on LinkedIn and Twitter rather than anywhere else, maybe it's the ease of use? (apps over opening VSCode to blog) Maybe it's just laziness.. either way I want this cycle to end and start to get serious once more.

I've given myself a 'lofty goal' for the end of the year and as we are already half way through, I need to get a shift on.

So as people are aware, I failed my first attempt at the OSCP. I knew going in I wasn't ready, the venue changed last minute, I had a massive problem with my sinuses that had only just cleared up, I felt like shit and prepaired like shit to do this 48 hour commitment.

24 hours of hacking
24 hours of report writing 
One exam
One OSCP

The mental fortitude just wasn't with me and obviously to not go into too much detail, it took me way to long to find and exploit my first box let alone the other points I scraped by to get.

This time things are going to be different.

I have a plan;

Yes, part of a plan!

I recetly took under my wing a very powerful laptop under the name 'Black-Betty', she is the single most powerful computer I have ever owned and I am going to be putting her to work... Not just gaming at Ultra-High Definition... But that too.

I have a fresh Kali Linux install, as well as Parrot (sick resolutions tho).

I have reset my Hack The Box account entirely (bye those 24 machines I pwnd).

I am starting from scratch and noting everything I do in Notion (Or Obsidian, not decided yet).

I want to not only 'git gud' again, but I want to excel.

I want to do writeups to every box (even if they dont come out often) and I want to do them well.

(Oh boy thats a lot of 'I's)

The time for slaying the beast is coming.

I am coming for the OSCP

I am going to win.

Yes I am firing on all cylinders, now I have settled into my job and doing well enough that I can focus back on getting back into hacking and getting the OSCP nailed out and maybe just maybe land a pentesting/red teaming role. 

Massive shout out and thank you to [@0x_hackerfren](https://x.com/0x_hackerfren), Jacob, for inspiring me to get off my butt and getting this done. Thank you mate.

Be Safe and Stay Dangerous friends, the future isn't written yet, so go grab that pen and write it!
