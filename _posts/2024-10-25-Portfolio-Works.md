Hey friends! 

I've been going through things lately, trying to streamline my life, get updated and cleared and tidy... The same things you would normally do to your house you should really do to yourself as well as your 'digital self' also.

Because of this for the last few days I have been having a good clear out.

I noticed that while my blog is pretty cool I am missing some of my 'old' works, some of that stuff I may not be able to actually get back again as well as looking at my stack of projects/programs/stuff I've done/coded and not done anything with.

It made me feel a little down as I am not able to fully show off my potential or how far I have come as a developer and technical writer so I am going to retroactively go back and add in each of the FUD Fighters Articles from my LinkedIn (incase anything ever happens to my account it's nice to have backups) as they have shown me grow as a researcher as well as a student and teacher in things like DNS. I am going to make specific pages for my completed GitHub projects, even the really odd ones like [Rejectorbot9000](https://ha3ks.github.io/posts/Rejectorbot9000/) and [Musk-to-Belson](https://ha3ks.github.io/posts/Musk-to-Belson/) which are a Python App and a Chrome Extension respectively, because I wanted to learn and try new things.

It's not much of an update by way of bringing something new to the table but It's just been a few days of feeling 'odd' and getting my head screwed back on properly.

Remember, Mental Health is important and Burnout hits all of us one way or another.

In fact recently I have been finding great joy in playing games again, only been like 200 days or something since I last properly played something.

It was Halo Infinite for any curious BTW and I set myself a nice little speed record to earn that 14 main missions in under 8 hours Achievement:

MicDrop.

I think the game prior was Jedi Survivor if the xbox screenshots thing is anything to go by.

Also I may have found a cheeky way to play GamePass games without having a GamePass account... ðŸ¤« ([I have reached out to them about it](https://x.com/ha3ks/status/1849079994061926757), yet to hear anything back mind...)

-- UPDATE -- 

Got in contact with Microsoft and Xbox support and it turns out the 'bug' I found is actually a 'feature' as the GamePass games are associated with the console itself not exclusively the accounts.

Good to know...... ðŸ˜ˆ

Anyway - as before be safe all.

ðŸ¤™
