Have you ever had a funny idea and thought, I could do that?

This is the story of Musk to Belson, because at this point (both historically at the time of creation and also now in 2024) what's the difference?

I had been watching all of Silicon Valley, as you do, and noticed some striking resemblances between Elon Musk and Gavin Belson both in the way they acted and they way they approached business..

At this time I had also been following [Nick Craver](https://x.com/Nick_Craver) (now on [Mastodon](https://infosec.exchange/@Nick_Craver)) and discovered the hilarity of cloud-to-butt which once enabled switched instances on the webpage of the phrase 'the cloud' to 'the butt' for much more hilarious reading.

So obviously I set about bastardizing the code to switch between Elon and Gavin because it was way funnier to see Gavin Belson plastered everywhere... still is by the way.

There is also a secret reason for this project and why I wanted to kick into it so quickly.

I wanted to learn how to inject malicious code into Chrome extensions.

Yes.

The Hacker mindset came to me after seeing my good internet friend [Jose Barrientos](https://x.com/el_mar1achi) had been doing much the same thing (though he has a lot more experience both on red teams as well as in development, so I think he ended up making his own C2 which would control said extensions) He's a good guy you should go give him a follow, he's awesome!

But as I said because of that I needed to know how extensions work and how they interact with the page and make changes, such as replacing text.. if I wanted to replace it with a malicious link to a certain dodgey website or something.

The list was endless and needless to say I did learn something.

Anyway here's the funny stuff the extension doing it;s job;

Absolute credit goes to Steven Frank for [Cloud-to-Butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt) for the idea and framework.
