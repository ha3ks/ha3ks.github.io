Yes, I am now an ICSI | Certified Network Security Specialist.

Honestly I haven’t been this happy for a cert in a long time, like 2 weeks, since I did the Autopsy Training.

<b>What does this mean for me?</b>

Well at the moment, probably not a lot, I am still out of work but I can now bolster my Linkedin and CV with some proper, recognised, official certifications in subjects I actually enjoy and want to progress further into.

<!--more-->

This course from a foundational standpoint is awesome, it clearly covers topics in an easy to understand manner that even someone such as myself with self diagnosed learning difficulties (read: dumbass) can understand and run with.

It is a self paced learning model which is also handy as I can go back over things, I never was good at reading things, especially in university, but as I age I’m starting to pickup on this reading malarkey.

None the less I have made use of the things I have been learning via Du’an Lightfoot and the #Labeveryday folks and made use of the MS One Note web clipper so I can go over the material anytime I like anywhere I like just to keep things fresh.

<b>All in all..</b>

I am incredibly happy with how things turned out.

This entire exercise has come to fruition thanks to [Daniel Card](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dancard/?originalSubdomain=uk) and his posting on Linkedin of also completing the course, as this is presently free to anyone who wishes to get the certification you can use this link to signup

The reason for this is due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a lot of companies are running free training or certifications which is understandable given the circumstance and also keeps people indoors, so good on any company that does this.

<b>Finally</b>

I’m going to button this up with a further shout out to Daniel Card and PwnDefend

It isn’t Global ThermoNuclear War but it is instead a fun way to get your kids (or yourself if your a big kid like me) into Computer CTF (Capture the Flag) games.

In this case its actually capture the cheese but who doesn’t like cheese (unless your lactose intolerant).

So I am also liking directly to the MyHackerMouse page: [https://myhackermouse.com/](https://myhackermouse.com/)

There are plenty of updates coming in the future and it will get your wheels turning when it comes to CTF and how to learn, progress and eventually dominate, be sure to be there or be square!
