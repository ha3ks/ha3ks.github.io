FINALLY(!!) I have found the time to sit and dedicate to sorting out this crushing, mind numbing issue once and for all.

## HTTPS

Yes, finally after, what 3 years(?) I sorted out the blogs biggest issue, it's domain name.

Now when you navigate to ha3ks.com it will actually take you there, no more pushing around to ha3ks.github.io (my backend provider as I don't know any better).

No redirects.

No Domain Masking.

Just 100% to the source (so to speak).

I can't beleive how long it has taken me to finally get down to business with this... now to work on my projects like [javascriptnear.me](https://javascriptnear.me) among others ðŸ˜‰

Be safe all, I am handling burnout poorly.

Peace

ðŸ¤™
