OK so not quite an â€˜one month check-inâ€™ though Iâ€™m still getting comfortable.

I have learned quite a bit of Python during the last 30 something days, much more then I knew before thatâ€™s for sure,, why Python you ask? because fuggit! May was well go with tried and trusted â€˜sink or swimâ€™ learning.

Something that has been rattling me recently, well not rattling more that â€˜annoying little nagging voiceâ€™ that lurks around the back of your mind. Hacking.

Iâ€™m not talking about â€˜hacking The Gibsonâ€™ though if you caught that fun little Easter Egg in Season 3 Episode 2 of Mr. Robot then go get yourself a shot on me ðŸ˜‰

I am a very â€˜practical assholeâ€™ I like to see what makes things tick and how to get them ticking differently, I find it hard to play with the same toys and Iâ€™m always looking to improve or change things. much to my other halfâ€™s (Yes OPSEC I do practice it sometimesâ€¦ vaguely) displeasure.

Lately something I have been faffing around with more is OSâ€™s or Computer Operating Systems in old English.

I was raised on Windows 95 (actually some stuff before this including Commodore but Iâ€™m not splitting hairs on the internet) and the pure unbridled joy of the Windows 95 Instructional Video (I lived in a Friends/Buffy household), this was my first real taste of computing (also light hacking when the power button decided to brake off into the PC and would not come back out causing me to do a slight bit of surgery on it).

Since 95 things have changed a lot, 2000 and XP were amazing, Longhorn was a pile of shit that needed to die in a fire, 10 is pretty good all things considered and also in this time my tastes have changed. I picked up a Mac (G3? I think with the white plastic bubble back not the cool see-thru colour ones) learned how to edit video and all that fun creative stuff.

Picked up Linux, mainly Ubuntu as its so familiar now. I have dabbled and looked to other Distros thanks to Virtual Box/VMWare etc etc etc. Arch was interesting but it just hurts my tiny tiny brain too much to work with (though I did get it running with XFCE4).

Which leads me onto my newest vice, fucking with my laptop and constantly reformatting it to Windows/Mac/Ubuntu. Iâ€™m settled on Ubuntu at the moment and its working well. the laptop isnâ€™t anything special and god knows it needs a 16GB stick of DDR4 ramming in it but I aint made of moneyâ€¦

So yeah, Iâ€™ve been keeping as best as I can to my learning thank god for Apps that you can do this in *hat tip Cybrary*, and wiping and clean installing an OS every other day when bored.

Iâ€™m trying to find a way to transcribe my learning into something that can actually be documented and works if you download the â€˜file.pyâ€™ with Githuib but it might be easier to poop source code onto the blog instead.

Something I have picked up on is that I want to take my learning to the Nth degree,

What I mean by this, I had an example Python Project, a receipt.

It would show full price, price with tax and also a price with tax and tip on top (stop me if this sounds familiar).

I love the project but while I was coding it I was thinking of ways I can take it all the way, I wanna make it prompt you to enter the food you had from a menu and then short code the name into a â€˜printableâ€™ receipt (ok likely a displayable output) and still do all the cool total+tax etc. Youâ€™ve all somehow seen a McDonaldâ€™s receipt rite? something like that with a cool format, made up logo or addressâ€¦ That is what I wanna do with the project, I wanna push it all the way to fulfil its potential.

I guess this means I have my working hat on, a burning desire to do things, DO WHAT YOU CANT and all that.

I liked that I ended the last post with a Futurama pic,, so why not try based on my learning and burning ðŸ˜‰
