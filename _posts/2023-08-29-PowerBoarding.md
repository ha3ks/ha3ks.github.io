## PowerBoarding

[![PB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ha3ks/PowerBoarding/refs/heads/main/complete.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ha3ks/PowerBoarding/refs/heads/main/complete.png)

This was a very niche project.

I needed a way to make my windows rebuilds faster.

For some ungodly reason I went through a period of re-imaging my laptop and torturing the SSD in it every other day, I don't really know why maybe just practice, maybe just the *tism.

Either way I had a dream about this about a year prior and started the project but completely scrapped it and deleted it.

Since then the need arose once more so I figured 'screw it' and built the thing at last.

Every now and again I do I really good README.md so I will let PowerBoarding take the reigns from here and you can check it out over at my GitHub
