Good Morning all, just a quick update from me while I start hearding cats in preperation for the OSCP round 2, still gotta sort the funding for that but future me can deal with that when I am ready.

I've been getting my 'environment' set up as of late, by this I mean not only getting my laptop working the way I want it to and look how I want it to (minus stickers at present) I've been trying to get a lot of 'home' stuff done also.

IRL me has A LOT going off behind the scenes and I shared a part of this recently on LinkedIn where I turned back on the 'Open to Work' flag in the hopes for remote working going forwards.

I have had a huge outpouring of support and status/job sharing from people and I appreciate every one who has reached out in regards to this. I have been going through the roles and applying for what I can, I can't help but feel that the pedegree of taking down the OSCP would help with a lot of cyber related roles not just specifically in a pentesting role.

More on this later though the point of this update is just a quick little 'oh sh*t it's July' and I need to start getting time management in place to block out sections of my diary for focussed study time.

I recently completely reset my Hack The Box account (bye those 24 boxes I had Pwned), as well as logged into the academy and started relearning things in there. 

God I am rusty...

The good news is though that rust scrubs off and if you have a good basic understanding you can learn/relearn anything. 

Infact FreeCodeCamps [Quincy Larson](https://x.com/ossia) recently did a podcast with long time reference point on my inspiration board, Scott Hanselman on being a 'Swiss Army Knife developer'

> 'Swiss Army Knife' in the sense that it kinda 'bad' at everything but it's also kinda 'good' at stuff. It's not a prefect at everything 'thing', but it's got a real good general sense and it'll let you survive.

I like this quote as it applies to everything as above. Having a good understainding of the basics like how packets move across the internet, networking, how certain tools work, what your meterpreter is doing, (as well as your OSCP materials in this case) all helps.

So yes, that is my update.

Massive Shoutout to [I_Am_Jakoby](https://x.com/I_Am_Jakoby) on this one, It's getting easier to understand Obsidian now and I may even transcribe my OSCP book into Obsidian for better linking and searching come exam time.

Be Safe and Stay Dangerous friends.
