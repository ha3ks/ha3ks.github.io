## AD_Permissions_ReportGEN

I would argue that *this* is what started me on disproving Snake Oil and lies on the internet.

My memory is a little foggy on this one as it's been years since it was built but from what I remember.

Someone on LinkedIn was claiming that an Application they had built in VB5 (from the looks, it was basic as sh*t) claimed that this 'Cyber Goldfinger Weapon' would, once ran, output a list of all AD users and their permissions in a csv file for easy checking and was worth ONE BILLION DOLLARS!

Yes.

That was my reaction too.

I literally fell off the chair with laughter.

I knew it wasn't worth anything, in fact I was entirely sure it was a built in feature of Windows and Powershell.

So after about 20 minutes of digging and a little quick test. I created a Powershell ps1 script that would output users and permissions from AD to a csv file.

Needless to say they shut up and disappeared REAL QUICK after this was revealed and even my good Dan [@UK_Daniel_Card](https://x.com/UK_Daniel_Card) tested this and shared the results on twitter. 

Yep did exactly what it should do and didn't cost anything besides 25 minutes of my time.

My first FUD Fighting activity was 20 minutes on Google and 5 minutes coding, If only I knew then (2021) what I would be doing in 2024 fighting the FUD still.

Good Times.
