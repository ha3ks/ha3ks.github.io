It's been a while since I put up a new post so lets have a little look at an example of practicing what im preaching.

Today I had to get a list of barcodes from a load of (like 97) .xml files (processed so renamed to .bak), each file could have between 1 and 90 different entries for barcode.
<!--more-->

While slowly copy pasting these one by one taking between 10 seconds or 10 minutes (as they arnt too easy to find). I thought to my self.

“There has to be a faster way of doing this”

And presto, an Idea popped into my head, I’ve been coding a little while now, cant I code something to do this crap for me.

The answer is… Yes!

Ok so my plan is to whip something together that can cycle through these files looking for specifically one line (multiple times), barcode. I dont have access to anything ‘fancy’ on my work machine but I do have Powershell, powershell has ISE so its very scriptable.

Lets walk through this peice by peice.

PS C:\Users\***>ise

This will open up the ISE interface of PowerShell

Here there are 3 sections, top is Script Pane, Bottom is Command Pane and the Right is the Add-on/Tools Pane (more on this later #EDIT, I never used this).

Now I’m using the ISE as that Script Pane lets me code and have it easier to read as well as editable on the fly for the many mistakes I will make.

Now I have the files in a folder on my desktop so I need to now figure out how to select the thing I am looking for, a quick google and I find the command ‘Select-String’ will work so this is my initail code:

select-string BARCODE C:\Users\***\Desktop\Folder\*.bak > C:\Users\***\Desktop\Results.txt

Lets break this down, the Select-String searches for text and text patterns in input strings and files. You can use it like Grep in UNIX and Findstr in Windows. You can type Select-String or its alias, sls. I am looking for the word BARCODE in the directory ‘C:\Users\***\Desktop\Folder\*.bak’ and I am pushing that result out to ‘C:\Users\***\Desktop\Results.txt’.  (Ah Pipes in Linux)

One line script and it poops out this following snip (I grabbed from in powershell the output .txt is the same):

Ok this is progress, it is showing me the file it came from and the full output of lines with BARCODE ON them, I could call it a day here as I can just search with Ctrl+F for the barcode I want but I want to go a little further.

I dont (immediately) need the file it came from so lets cut that part out, to do that though I had to do a little more Googling and a little more searching through StackOverflow and made this work for me:

Select-String -Path C:\Users\***\Desktop\Folder\*.bak -Pattern “BARCODE” -Context 1,1 |
ForEach-Object {
$_.Line
} | Out-File C:\Users\***\Desktop\Results.txt

Ok so this is a little more fun, its looking for context around BARCODE only and pops each result on a new line, the output of which is:

[![Snip]({{ site.contenturl }}snip2.jpg)]({{ site.contenturl }}snip2.jpg)

Ok then now we’re talking, still ugly mind, but now I have just the details I am looking for.

Lets go one step further, lets get just the barcodes, all 4,400+ of them (Copy pasting manually even at this point would have been hours as apposed to miutes of Google and Test)

For that I had to fight with Powershell some more and ended up with this:

$arr = @()
$path = “C:\Users\***\Desktop\Folder\*.bak”
$pattern = “(?<=.*<BARCODE>)\w+?(?=</BARCODE>.*)”

Get-Content $path | Foreach {if ([Regex]::IsMatch($_, $pattern)) {
$arr += [Regex]::Match($_, $pattern)
}
}
$arr | Foreach {$_.Value} > “C:\Users\***\Desktop\Results.txt”

Righty, so this ‘monster’ of a script is looking for the pattern between <BARCODE> and </BARCODE>, calling to regex and doing some other flimflammery that I cant even comprehend as Im tired but here we go the output of this is (from the text file):

BOOM, nailed it.

Proving that scripting rules the world and Im not even that familiar with Powershell so this is a god send.

Takeaways from this lesson:

If you think it can be scripted, DO THE WORK and it can be.
Learning can be fun.
Having to do work slowly is a great motivator for making scripts.
Sleep is a good idea, as is food.
If its not super critical (i.e one off), it can be quick and dirty.
All in all this project took about 30 minutes to complete and thats with some googling and trying to download the files I needed (also trying grep for windows which flat out would not work).
