Ok yes it was a good film, but this is actually a post to show off some of my other tool kit.

A while back I created some training documents for my ‘then’ employer to fill in some knowledge gaps between staff, while the documents were technically sound, the cord got pulled on the project in favour of them hiring an actual trainer and that as this wasn’t a part of my actual job spec I shouldn’t be doing it but I like to help people.

Now I can’t present the actual documents due to trade secrets and etc but I can show you the title cards for a few of them, edited to redact employer.

Anyone who works in an UK based ISP will understand the pain.
