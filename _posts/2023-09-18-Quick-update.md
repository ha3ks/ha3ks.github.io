So as a man of my word, I have been chipping away at TryHackMe again and I've nearly regained H4CK3R rank again (Level 8) used to be G0D (Max Level) and upwards but after my 'great reset' it's nice to get back into the swing of things.

Also I wasn't kidding, 5 days ago:

And now:

It's amazing how quickly you can make progress when your remembering juices are flowing haha!

It's also been spurred on by another missed opportunity in the job market where they again have decided to go with people who have more experience (read actual workplace experience not all the theoretical I do on the daily).

This s**t bites.

I had a gut-wrenching experience with my work coach as well, I can't go into too much detail but this is one of those situations where I have never been made to feel more like 'a number' in my entire life... I'm a person, not a number.

For now, I'm going to keep chipping away.

Be safe ðŸ¤™
