Hey friends, turns out I'm terrible at updating my blog haha!

Actually I have been super busy IRL with my new job and I've had everything slide in priority:

See!

I feel gutted I got to 83 days (with a 1 day freeze hence that one gap then full day following it), but I know that it has been a lot to do in such a short time.

I've even let my LinkedIn slide though that is more from dealing with the ongoing torrent of lies and bullsh*t coming from a certain 'named global expert in DNS and asset management' thusly named because he paid an agency to put it out there.

I know Christmas is around the corner, like literally 5 days away and I also know being a grown up what 'my present' is and honestly I am really looking forward to it.

I actually see it as a kind of 'fresh start', I want to be a little more 'on it' when it comes to creating content and also writing up my CTF stuff, so I've decided that is exactly what I am going to do.

Starting '24 I am turning over a new leaf, still the same Dan but with a little more pizazz! I've been inspired by people like [Andrew Roderos](https://twitter.com/andrewroderos) and his [blog](https://andrewroderos.com/), [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/) and [Ernest Ogbuanya](https://twitter.com/Cisco_Panther).

Finding ways to share stories via content and also educate others, it's kinda a dream of mine to help as many others as I can, so as above, '24 is a fresh start and a new try at being better.

I have considered moving the blog from free hosting on GitHub to some kind of paid service/Wordpress, I'm still undecided but I do enjoy some of the integrations and post sharing (automatically) etc so it's currently being mulled over by my brain.

Let's see how this goes!

For now, be safe, be well, Merry Christmas from my family to yours and I'll see you all next year! ðŸ¤™
